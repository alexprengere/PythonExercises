## Exercise 2

### Problem

For this second exercise, we want to write a program `premier.py` who displays prime numbers between two given numbers.

The program should work as follow:
```bash
$ python premier.py 10 15
11
13
```

### Bonus

It may be interesting to display prime factors of non-prime numbers, for example `12 = 2 * 2 * 3`.

### Help

In Python, you can get the rest of the division of an integer by another one with `%`:
```python
5 % 3 # returns 2
4 % 2 # returns 0 because 2 divides 4 ;)
```
